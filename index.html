    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I’m Inderjeet Singh, an IT professional passionate about cybersecurity, cloud technologies, and analytics. With nearly three years of experience at MetLife in the GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) domain, I have developed strong skills in risk assessment, compliance checks, and IT security operations.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology and have completed the CompTIA CySA+ certification, along with the SOC Level 1 path on TryHackMe. These experiences have given me hands-on expertise in threat detection, incident response, log and network analysis, digital forensics, and working with SIEM tools like Splunk in real-world SOC environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of the professional world, I enjoy staying active at the gym and challenging myself with chess, which helps me keep my analytical and strategic thinking sharp.
